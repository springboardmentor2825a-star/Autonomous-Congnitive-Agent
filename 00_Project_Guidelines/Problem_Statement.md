# Problem Statement

Design and build an Autonomous Cognitive Engine capable of executing deep research and long-horizon tasks using GenAI.

The system should simulate how modern AI agents work in real-world environments by:

- Understanding high-level goals
- Breaking them into sub-tasks
- Planning and executing steps autonomously
- Using external tools and knowledge sources
- Maintaining memory
- Evaluating its own outputs
- Escalating to humans when confidence is low

Example goals:
- “Research an emerging technology and generate an executive report.”
- “Monitor a domain weekly and summarize important changes.”
- “Analyze a business problem and propose strategic options.”
