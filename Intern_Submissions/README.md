### 🔹 Agent Roles
1. **Research Specialist Agent**
   - Performs deep information retrieval
   - Gathers relevant domain knowledge
   - Provides structured research outputs

2. **Data Analyst Agent**
   - Analyzes collected data and findings
   - Identifies patterns, trends, and insights
   - Converts raw information into actionable intelligence

3. **Content Writer Agent**
   - Synthesizes insights into well-structured reports
   - Generates human-readable explanations and summaries
   - Ensures clarity, coherence, and logical flow

### 🔹 Orchestration Layer
- Coordinates task execution between agents
- Manages agent interaction flow
- Ensures consistent output generation
